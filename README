This is a collection of single file application codes that I mostly wrote for
family and friends. Some are for my students to use as reference. I just
thought it would be a good idea if I pool them together into a single
repository for my future reference. I have wasted a lot of time rewriting codes
like this in the past - well, when I started doing programming, I do not even
have my own PC. Basically, I just want to avoid having to rewrite codes that
are similar in nature.

Codes from my1codelib and my1termu can also be used. For example, to compile
uartsend.c (which equires my1termu),

    make TARGET=uartsend OBJLST="my1cons.o my1comlib.o my1bytes.o"
