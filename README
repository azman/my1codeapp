This is a collection of single file application codes that I mostly wrote for
family and friends. I just thought it would be a good idea if I pool them
together into a single repository for my future reference. I have wasted a lot
of time rewriting codes like this in the past - well, when I started doing
programming, I do not even have my own PC. Basically, I just want to avoid
having to rewrite codes that are similar in nature.
